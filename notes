Explanation:

Import Libraries: We import libraries for train-test split, classification model (RandomForestClassifier), and optionally for classification report generation.
classify_anomaly_type Function: This function takes normal data, anomaly data, and a list of possible anomaly types.
Feature Engineering (Optional): You might want to create additional features from the sensor data that could be helpful for classification. 4. Combine Data and Labels: We combine normal and anomaly data into single arrays (X) and create labels (y) where 0 represents normal data and 1 represents anomaly. We then split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a Classification Model: This example uses a RandomForestClassifier. You can experiment with other classifiers like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Neural Networks depending on your data characteristics.
Classification Report (Optional): We can use the classification_report function to evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
Return Model: The function returns the trained model.
Example Usage: This section demonstrates how to use the function with your data and predict the type of anomaly for a new data point.
Note:

This is a basic example. You might need to adjust parameters like the chosen classifier, feature engineering techniques, or hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
Ensure your labeled anomaly data covers the different types of anomalies you aim to classify.
Consider using techniques like cross-validation for a more robust evaluation of the model's generalizability.
